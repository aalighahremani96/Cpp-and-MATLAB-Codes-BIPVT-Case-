This project focuses on the analysis of a Building-Integrated Photovoltaic/Thermal (BIPVT) system. The implemented Python, MATLAB and C++ codes calculate:

-Duct outlet air temperature

-Photovoltaic cell temperature

-Other parts temperature 

-Heat gained by the system

-Mass flow rate in the duct

-Various system efficiencies (electrical and overall)

The purpose is to provide proof of coding and programing capabilities in Python, c++ and Matlab.
